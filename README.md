# work-day-scheduler #
## Coding bootcamp week 05 challenge ##

This application is a simple work day scheduler. The page displays the current date and has rows for each hour or a 9 to 5 work day. The user is able to input data in the text area corresponding to hour listed beside it. Clicking the blue floppy disk icon to the right of the row will save the information. This data is stored in local storage and will persist if the page is refreshed. The colour of the row for each hour of the day will change colour as the day progresses based on the current time the page is being viewed. Grey indicates the hour has already passed, red indicates the current hour and green indicates a time in the future. 

The HTML and CSS files were provided for this challenge. The HTML needed to be modified to make the application work as specified with the CSS file. The CSS file was complete and gave clues as to how to structure the HTML file using JQuery and Bootstrap. This challenge was a consolidation of the concepts learned in the previous week with a focus on using third party APIs JQuery, Bootstrap and Moment JS.
